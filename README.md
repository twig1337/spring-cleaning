# spring-cleaning
A short script for Ubuntu to update, upgrade, remove vestigial packages and extra Linux kernels all in one go!
##Installation##
* `git clone https://github.com/twig1337/spring-cleaning.git`
* `cd spring-cleaning`
* Move the `sprint-cleaning` script into a `bin` directory.

###Misc.###
I've tested this on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, though it _should_* be safe to use on most debian based distros.

*Note: This script uses `dist-upgrade`. If you're working in a production environment you will probably want to change that to `upgrade`.
